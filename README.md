The main objective of this web map to provide users an additional understanding of this news article with an interactive map displaying the locations, directions, and installation dates of these cameras, 
which are essential for understanding their distribution across the city.
This web map application visualizes the locations of red-light cameras in Chicago, allowing users to explore data about camera placements across the city. 
The primary goal is to provide an interactive experience where users can view the locations, directions, and installation dates of red-light cameras. 
The map employs custom camera emoji icons for each camera, with informative popups that display additional details. 
A histogram, created using Chart.js, showcases the trends in red-light camera installations by year.
The article I used for inspiration was Red-Light Cameras Take Another $500M from Illinois Drivers in 5 Years by the Illinois Policy Institute, the article talks about the financial impact of red light cameras in Illinois. 
According to the article, "red-light camera fines in Illinois have exceeded $1.56 billion since 2008, with Chicago accounting for over $915.5 million of that total". 
As this map suggest was a lot of of redlight cameras being built around 2008, this is important for understanding the distribution of these cameras and their broader implications on drivers and city finances.
